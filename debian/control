Description: High-performance regular expression matching library
 Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library.
 It follows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre library,
 but is a standalone library with its own C API. Hyperscan uses hybrid automata
 techniques to allow simultaneous matching of large numbers (up to tens of thousands)
 of regular expressions and for the matching of regular expressions across streams
 of data. Hyperscan is typically used in a DPI library stack.
